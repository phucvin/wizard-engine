# Performance Testing #

## What tests should *do*: ##

1. Check performance improvement with non-intrinsified vs. intrinsified (with each available optimization tier)
    1. memory usage
    2. runtime impact
2. Stress testing (high frequency of callback being attached)
3. Composition of multiple whamm monitors
    1. multiple probes at a single location

## Workloads for testing: ##

TODO: Brainstorm the application workloads to exercise the monitors with.
